# Project Outline
For this assignment, you will submit a high-level outline of your project. This can, and likely will, change over time. In particular, your mentor will provide direction and feedback to help sharpen your ideas. So don't worry if you feel unsure about some aspects of the outline or if you have to change some things later.

## Submission Instructions

### Overview
There are unique challenges to any kind of content creation if one wants to make a name for themselves. I host a
podcast, and it is extremely challenging to get any kind of exposure for it, and it is also extremely challenging
to get any useful criticism. I envision a content sharing platform where users could specifically sign up for the
purpose of sharing their work with others in the same field. They could provide constructive criticism of other
people's work while getting some of their own, and in turn make connections in the field while possibly building
a fanbase once the work improves.

The idea is basic upload and download, of whatever a person makes. Music, essays, podcasts, or
whatever it may be. We have YouTube and such to an extent, but this would specifically work as a mutual educational
tool. To game it out, just imagine that someone uploads an episode of their podcast that they think gives a good idea
of what they bring to the table. Another user listens and enjoys it, but recognizes a sound quality problem in the
production that they have learned to fix. This user can leave a comment or send a message to the other user with
this information. This could go beyond technical concerns into ideas about songwriting, ways to increase reader
engagement, anything. Basically, this would be an online workshop for content creators. 
### Features
User login: Users will be able to create unique profiles and log in to the application on their accounts.
Upload: Users will be able to upload their work to a shared space where others can access it.
Download: Users will be able to download the work others have uploaded.
Commment: Users will be able to leave comments on others' uploads after having viewed them.
### Technologies
Java
SpringBoot
MySQL
Hibernate
Thymeleaf templates
### What I'll Have to Learn
I will need to learn how to let users upload files into a SQL database, and then I will also have to learn how to
allow users to download files from that database. I will have to learn how to enable commenting, but I think that
should be fairly straightforward - the principle should be similar to any time I created a web app that allowed users
to type a response of some kind, except this time their input would print on the screen in some format.
